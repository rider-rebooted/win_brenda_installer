# win_brenda_installer
Python script to automate the installation of Brenda on to Windows. Work in progress.

**WARNING, THIS IS MY FIRST PYTHON PROJECT AND IT MAY HAVE SERIOUS ISSUES WHICH COULD POTENTIALLY COST YOU MONEY. PLEASE ONLY USE THIS IF YOU ARE FAMILIAR WITH PYTHON AND BRENDA AND YOU ARE HAPPY WITH MY CODE. ALSO MAKE SURE YOU ARE AWARE OF THE ISSUES I'VE POSTED - THERE ARE MORE!**

**Only steps 1-5 included so far**

Step by step installer for getting James Yonan's [Brenda](https://github.com/jamesyonan/brenda) for Blender to operate on Windows instead of Linux. This installer automates Todd Mcintosh's [directions](http://brendapro.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=0&t=76&sid=e6bc8c5335e35bab0605da5a5a6f9965). It's my first Python project so i'm sure it has issues but seems to work ok for me.
 
#HOW TO INSTALL#

Install Python 2.7 onto Windows

Download the "win_brenda_installer.py" file and move it to your "C:\Python27" directory. Shift-right click an empty space in the explorer folder and select "open command window here". Type "python win_brenda_installer.py" to run the installer. It assumes you already have s3 project and frame buckets set up and ready to go.
